# Square → PRISM Alert Overlay (Files)

## What this is
A self-hosted alert overlay system:
- GitHub Pages hosts `alerts.html` and `setup.html`
- Cloudflare Worker receives Square webhooks and exposes `/latest`
- PRISM adds the overlay as a Web source (browser)

## Files
- alerts.html : overlay page (what PRISM loads)
- setup.html  : setup wizard page (stores settings in browser LocalStorage)
- effect-map.json : example amount→effect label map
- worker.js   : Cloudflare Worker backend (Square webhook + /latest + /test)

## Transparency
Setup is stored in **browser LocalStorage**.
If you clear site data/cache, you must redo setup.

## PRISM URL
Use the URL generated by `setup.html`, or:
https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/REPO/alerts.html?api=https://YOURWORKER.workers.dev
